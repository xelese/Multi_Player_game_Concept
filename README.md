# PDC-Project
It is a multiplayer Game using the concept of distributed systems

The Idea of this project is to implement and showcase a demo game for a distributed system by developing it through Unity engine.
There are multiple people contributing to this idea and we are trying to get a small multiplayer game running on different computers to 
demostrate its effictiveness. So far we have implemented a networked game that runs on multiple computers whose task is to finish of the enemy. The game is purely for demo purposes and is heavily under development.

For the network to recognize and handle players and spawning we use a prefab called network manager which has a network manager script attached to it.

We see that visible skinned meshes go us as new players join indicating higher number of players.
